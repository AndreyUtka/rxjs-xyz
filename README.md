# rxjs-xyz

This repo contains the Gatsby source for the [rxjs.xyz](https://rxjs.xyz) site - which is a listing of community-authored RxJS packages.

The site was created to, hopefully, increase the visibility of packages that contain APIs that have been deemed to be non-core. The core RxJS API is already large and when feature requests are made, they are often rejected - with the author asked to first implement the API in a user-land package. The [rxjs.xyz](https://rxjs.xyz) site is a listing of such packages.

To list a package on the site, please see the instructions in [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
